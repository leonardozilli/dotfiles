# The template for screenshot filenames. See below for explanation of the property expansion!
# Can be an absolute or relative path (though relative paths are mostly untested)
output_template='/home/leo/Pictures/mpv_screenshots/${filename}_${%unique:%03d}.png'
# The above template would expand to something like "Sintel.2010.1080p 00.05.40.500 200x400 001.png".
# or just "Sintel.2010.1080p 00.05.40.500.png" for the full-size screenshots (if kept).
# The template checks if 'full' is falsey, in which case it will expand the crop size and sequence number.

# Whether to try and create missing directories when saving screenshots
# (All directories will be created, not just the last section)

# Whether to keep the original full-size screenshot or not

# You can disable the automatic keybind to 'c' and add your own, see below
